# AQL

`AQL` is an abstract query language, similar to `SQL`, 
that can be used as an abstraction layer over databases.

`AQL` is an **abstraction layer** which helps describe business logic closely tied to object storage. 

`AQL` is **not an ORM** solution but a `DSL` — a tool for implementing business logic 
that is closely tied to the way data is stored.
